# unit-testing-and-git-project
The group assignment is focused on unit testing and collaboration within a team. 
The goal of this assignment is to work together as a team to develop and execute unit tests for a specific software project. 
Unit testing is a critical aspect of software development that involves testing individual units or components of code to ensure they function correctly in isolation. 
By collaborating effectively as a team, you can streamline the unit testing process, identify and fix bugs, and improve the overall quality of the software.
